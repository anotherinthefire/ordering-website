        <h3>Refund Policy for Online Purchase</h3>
        <p>Generally, only defective items or wrong order/s sent by our staff may be exchanged. But reasonable cases
          like wrong sizing can be an exception to the rule.</p>
        <p>Any item or product purchased in consignment stores may not be exchanged or returned through the online
          store. Those purchased in the flagship store may only be exchanged and/or returned also in the flagship store
          provided that the customer still has the receipt of the said item and that it falls within the 7-day period.
        </p>
        <p>For the exchange request to be accepted and granted, the following guidelines and procedures must be
          followed:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The particular item or product to be returned or exchanged shall be in the same exact condition as it was
            received by the customer. Tags, codes, and even the packaging of the said item shall be included in its
            return. Should the item in question be washed, damaged, worn, or in any way or manner not be in its original
            condition, the return or exchange shall not be granted. (WE DO NOT ISSUE REFUNDS)</li>
          <li>Only orders obtained within 7 days from the date of purchase may be exchanged. Anime X Gaming Guild (AXGG)â„¢ reserves the right to verify if all the information given by the customer is true and correct. The management won't process the exchange if the customer fails to comply with all the terms and conditions provided below.
          </li>
          <li>The shipment of both products or the return of the original order and the item to be exchanged for shall both be at the expense of the customer and the fees shall be shouldered by him or her.</li>
          <li>Notify our Customer Service representative of the exchange request and state your reason for the said petition (email at axggstore@gmail.com) then browse the website to check the availability of the item you want in replacement of your original order.</li>
          <li>Take note that the change in size request is still subject to approval. Once approved, you should receive an email from us stating that the size was successfully changed.</li>
          <li> After approval, our Customer service representative will give our shipping details where they would return their original order, and payment details where they would send the shipping fee.</li>
          <li>Once the item is received and the payment of fees is confirmed, the replacement and request for the new item shall be processed and shipped right away</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Please be advised that online transactions only take place from Monday to Saturday from 9 am until 6 pm</p>
        <p>If you still have further questions, you may email us at axggstore@gmail.com.</p>
